## Personal Website Project

## How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion

- **Application of Concepts Taught:** Firstly, I began with the basic html codes {doctype, html, head, body}. Then I apply the layout of the code with html. Then I use CSS in-order to arrange, fix, adjust depending on how I see fit. I also use scripting for the Loading screen where it will be shown until the page is fully loaded. And lastly, have added simple animations to make it a bit interactive and not bland.

- **Creativity and Design:** I personally have made a website before when I was a kid back in gradeschool that is why I used some as base. Moreover I have looked the internet, my friend's website and the links sir has give, which had proven helpful when I was designing it. Moreover, I used the Original Character, which is my "persona", that I drew since I was a kid. As the base for the website's theme.

- **Content:** I have used a brief introduction, details about me, and I used my resume instead, which was already approved by our previous professor, as my experiences and achievements. My contacts which is ranging from Facebook to github to Discord. Lastly, are the notable projects that I have made throughout the years. (Could have added more but I couldn't find enough resources to post it)

- **Deployment:** Like how sir also tells us, we created a repository and fork it to our own PC, so any changes can be easily pushed back to the main. Moreoever, I have followed the github.io format which enables to run my website.

## Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)

- The more the topics undergo, the more I got intrigued with the capabilites it offers. Like there are specific techniques like flexbox that would easily help me "sort" or arrange different objects simultaneously. Lastly, Animations really does make the website more interactive and entertaining in a sense.

## Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)

- The only struggle I had is the cramming, and I should have listened to sir on not cramming it. Because of cramming I haven't slept for 2 days. I have finished it but I know to myself that I can do better. So Lesson Learned for me. Moreover, the explanation and guidance that sir Job gives, makes struggles non-existent.

## How you could improve your website in the future

- First off, is by having better use of flexbox, by adding more animation to make it more interactive, use of transitions when moving between pages, and lastly, use many yet consistent features for the website.

## Other thoughts that might be noteworthy

- NEVER CRAM WEBSITE CREATION! because you are definitely going to experiment and think of different designs, assets, and features which will consume A LOT OF TIME.
- Also, it is great to have Photoshop Skills while creating a Website because you can either create or alter a design/asset to fit the theme of your website.
